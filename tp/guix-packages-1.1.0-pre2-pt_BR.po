"\n"

"@item Easy: Doing backups should be a frictionless process, otherwise you\n"
"might be tempted to skip it.  Restic should be easy to configure and use, "
"so\n"
"that, in the event of a data loss, you can just restore it.  Likewise,\n"

"@item Fast: Backing up your data with restic should only be limited by your\n"
"network or hard disk bandwidth so that you can backup your files every day.\n"
"Nobody does backups if it takes too much time.  Restoring backups should "
"only\n"
"transfer data that is needed for the files that are to be restored, so that\n"
"this process is also fast.\n"
"\n"
"@item Verifiable: Much more important than backup is restore, so restic\n"
"enables you to easily verify that all data can be restored.  @item Secure:\n"
"Restic uses cryptography to guarantee confidentiality and integrity of your\n"
"data.  The location the backup data is stored is assumed not to be a "
"trusted\n"
"environment (e.g.  a shared space where others like system administrators "
"are\n"
"able to access your backups).  Restic is built to secure your data against\n"
"such attackers.\n"
"\n"
"@item Efficient: With the growth of data, additional snapshots should only\n"
"take the storage of the actual increment.  Even more, duplicate data should "
"be\n"
"de-duplicated before it is actually written to the storage back end to save\n"
